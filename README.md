# stratospheric-polar-vortex
python code relating to plotting and analyzing the stratospheric polar vortex in either the Northern or Southern Hemisphere

Currently has one program, to make an animation of the Southern Hemisphere Stratospheric Polar Vortex, in terms of 850K isentropic potential vorticity. Uses CFSv2 isentropic data from the NOMADS server.  The output is a bunch of png plots that I use Imagemagick to convert into a GIF. Coded in Python by a Fortran thinker without comments, so ... sorry!
